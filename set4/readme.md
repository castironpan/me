TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

Learnt how to open and close files - how to write to them

Gained better understanding of dictionaries as well and how to access JSON files

Was cool to problem solve and love that you gave a straightforward IOexamples.py
to help us start off this exercise

OH, also learnt how to access links and alter URLs
